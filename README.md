# AWS GRC Projects

This repository showcases hands-on projects that combine **AWS Cloud Security** with **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** skills.  
Each project demonstrates how to apply compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, CIS Benchmarks, NIST CSF, GDPR) within AWS environments.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. Policy & Risk Register Project
- Authored a **Cloud Security Policy** covering IAM, encryption, logging, backups, and incident response.  
- Built a **Risk Register** identifying AWS-specific threats (e.g., S3 misconfigurations, IAM over-privilege, CloudTrail gaps).  
- Created an **Evidence Log** documenting audit-ready proof (screenshots, CLI outputs, JSON exports).
