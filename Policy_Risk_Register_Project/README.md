# Policy & Risk Register Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a **Cloud Security Policy**, a **Risk Register**, and an **Evidence Log** for AWS environments.  
It simulates real-world GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) practices used to align cloud operations with compliance frameworks such as **ISO 27001, SOC 2, CIS Benchmarks, and NIST CSF**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define a **Cloud Security Policy** for AWS covering access control, encryption, logging, backups, and incident response.  
- Build a **Risk Register** identifying AWS-specific threats, their likelihood/impact, and mitigating controls.  
- Collect **audit evidence** (screenshots, CLI outputs, exports) in an **Evidence Log** to demonstrate compliance readiness.  

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- **Cloud_Security_Policy.md** – Governance document for AWS cloud security.  
- **Risk_Register_Expanded.csv** – Register of AWS risks with scoring and treatments.  
- **Evidence_Log.csv** – Log of compliance evidence tied to risks and controls.  
- **Evidence/** – Screenshots, CLI outputs, and JSON exports as proof for auditors.

## 🛠️ Steps Taken
1. Drafted a **Cloud Security Policy** aligned to ISO 27001 Annex A, CIS Benchmarks, SOC 2, and GDPR.  
2. Created a **Risk Register** with AWS-specific risks (e.g., S3 misconfigurations, IAM over-privilege, CloudTrail gaps).  
3. Scored risks by **likelihood × impact** and assigned mitigating controls (Config, GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer).  
4. Collected **audit-ready evidence** (screenshots and AWS CLI outputs).  
5. Organized all deliverables into a GitHub-friendly project folder.

## ✅ Results
- A complete **governance and compliance package** for AWS security.  
- Demonstrates ability to assess risks, document controls, and prepare audit evidence.  
- Highlights **GRC Analyst skills** in cloud environments.
